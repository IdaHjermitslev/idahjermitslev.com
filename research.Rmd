#### Hjermitslev, Ida B. (forthcoming) ["The electoral cost of coalition participation: Can anyone escape?"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354068818794216) *Party Politics*

It is a well-established empirical finding that governments on average lose votes during their time in office. This exploratory analysis examines whether all members of coalition governments suffer the electoral cost of governing equally. Using electoral data from 20 parliamentary systems from 1961 to 2015, I compare the electoral performance of junior coalition members, the prime minister of a coalition, and single-party governments. Furthermore, I examine the conditioning effects of economic performance, legislative institutions as well as party ideology and size. I find that there are substantial differences in the electoral cost of governing for different types of coalition participation. The evidence suggests that the prime minister in a coalition is partially insulated from the penalties of government and thus should try to attract junior coalition members whenever possible.

#### Group identity or policy compromise? Coalition-based inferences about opposition parties

Are voters' perceptions of opposition parties altered by the formation of a coalition government? Recent studies suggest that voters in multiparty systems use coalition information to make inferences about governing parties' ideological positions. I argue that a similar mechanism applies to opposition parties, but that varying levels of political sophistication among voters will motivate different inferences due to fundamental differences in how voters conceptualize the left-right. Using survey data from both the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems 1996-2018 and the European Election Study 1989-2014, I find that coalition formation has an impact on the perception of opposition parties that is comparable in size to that of coalition partners, but the direction is contingent on the individual level of education, political interest and knowledge. Low sophisticates view all opposition parties as similar, while high sophisticates perceive opposition parties as different if divided by the current coalition government.

#### Do Voters Make Different Inferences about Economic and Cultural Issues?

The distinction between parties in coalition and in opposition may be the most important signal that structures voters' perceptions of political parties' positions and their understanding of the political space more generally. Do voters only perceive coalitions to be closer together on the left-right dimensions or do they perceive them as closer on more specific issues as well? Are there differences between issues, such that coalition partners are perceived to be closer on some issues, but not on others? And why? In an exploratory analysis, I examine whether coalition signals have a stronger impact on voters' perceptions of party positions on a range of policy issues. I compare the perceptions of parties before and after a coalition formation that (formally or informally) involved a radical right party. I rely on party placements from the Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies (1981-2012) and the Danish National Election Study (1994-2015).

#### Operationalizing Niche Parties: Definitional Disagreement and its Implications for Strategic Party Behavior (with [Jelle Koedam](http://jellekoedam.com))

The literature on the concept of niche parties is rapidly growing. Yet, despite a common sense understanding of what characterizes this subset of European political parties, and how they are different from their mainstream competitors, little consensus exist on their operationalization. This paper explores the variation in the main definitions that scholars have used to identify niche parties, or “nicheness”, and analyzes its implications for the validity of the findings about the appeal and strategic behavior of these parties. We replicate one of the most cited articles in this field (Ezrow et al. 2010), which argues that niche parties are more responsive to their supporters than mainstream parties. Using a variety of elite and mass-level datasets, covering more than twenty countries in the period 2002-2016, we show that this key finding is sensitively dependent on the employed definition, as well as the assumption of unidimensional political contestation. This paper has important implications for our understanding of party strategy and democratic representation. This paper explores the variation in the main definitions that scholars have used to identify niche parties, or ``nicheness", and analyzes its implications for the validity of the findings about the appeal and strategic behavior of these parties.
