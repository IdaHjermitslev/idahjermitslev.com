<h4>Hjermitslev, Ida B. (forthcoming) <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354068818794216">“The electoral cost of coalition participation: Can anyone escape?”</a> <em>Party Politics</em></h4>
<p>It is a well-established empirical finding that governments on average lose votes during their time in office. This exploratory analysis examines whether all members of coalition governments suffer the electoral cost of governing equally. Using electoral data from 20 parliamentary systems from 1961 to 2015, I compare the electoral performance of junior coalition members, the prime minister of a coalition, and single-party governments. Furthermore, I examine the conditioning effects of economic performance, legislative institutions as well as party ideology and size. I find that there are substantial differences in the electoral cost of governing for different types of coalition participation. The evidence suggests that the prime minister in a coalition is partially insulated from the penalties of government and thus should try to attract junior coalition members whenever possible.</p>

<h4>The enemy of my enemy is a friend? Coalition-based inferences about opposition parties</h4>
<p>Are voters’ perceptions of opposition parties altered by the formation of a coalition government? Recent studies suggest that voters in multiparty systems use coalition information to make inferences about governing parties’ ideological positions. I argue that a similar mechanism applies to opposition parties. Using survey data from the European Election Study 1989-2014, I find that coalition formation has an impact on the perception of opposition parties that is comparable in size to that of coalition partners. However, when one distinguishes between different types of oppposition relationships the effect is much larger. When two opposition parties are divided by a centrist coalition, voters will perceive them as approximately half a unit further apart on a 0-10 scale, holding everything else constant, but if they are located in the same bloc they are perceived as closer together. Additionally, I demonstrate that the strength of the relationship is contingent on the individual level of political interest and formal education. Unlike previous accounts of coalition heuristics, I find that voters with high levels of political sophistication appear much more sensitive to coalition signals.</p>

<h4>Mainstream Sell-outs? How collaborating with the radical right changes perceptions of economic and cultural positions.</h4>
<p>European mainstream right parties are increasingly choosing to include radical right parties in coalition governments or other types of stable and committed cooperation. How does this cooperation affect voters’ perceptions of party positions? I examine whether coalition signals have a stronger impact on voters’ perceptions on the specific policy issues that were at stake in the bargaining process. Does the issue ownership of the radical right cause voters to perceive mainstream parties as radicalizing on cultural issues pertaining to immigration and multiculturalism? I compare the perceptions of Dutch parties before and after two coalition formations that (formally and informally) involved a radical right party: the coalition with the List Pim Fortuyn in 2002 and the support agreement with the Freedom Party in 2010. Furthermore, I examine the long-term effects of the Danish mainstream right government relying on the support of the radical right Danish People’s Party in 2001-2011.</p>

<h4>Operationalizing Niche Parties: Definitional Disagreement and its Implications for Strategic Party Behavior (with <a href="http://jellekoedam.com">Jelle Koedam</a>)</h4>
<p>The literature on the concept of niche parties is rapidly growing. Yet, despite a common sense understanding of what characterizes this subset of European political parties, and how they are different from their mainstream competitors, little consensus exist on their operationalization. This paper explores the variation in the main definitions that scholars have used to identify niche parties, or “nicheness”, and analyzes its implications for the validity of the findings about the appeal and strategic behavior of these parties. We replicate one of the most cited articles in this field (Ezrow et al. 2010), which argues that niche parties are more responsive to their supporters than mainstream parties. Using a variety of elite and mass-level datasets, covering more than twenty countries in the period 2002-2016, we show that this key finding is sensitively dependent on the employed definition, as well as the assumption of unidimensional political contestation. This paper has important implications for our understanding of party strategy and democratic representation. This paper explores the variation in the main definitions that scholars have used to identify niche parties, or ``nicheness“, and analyzes its implications for the validity of the findings about the appeal and strategic behavior of these parties.</p>
